  instr 1
iOct      octmidi; read in midi pitch in Csound's 'oct' format
iAmp      ampmidi 0.1; read in note velocity - re-range to be from 0 to 0.2
kVol      ctrl7   1,1,0,1; read in controller 1, channel 1. Re-range to be from 0 to 1
kPortTime linseg  0,0.001,0.01; create a value that quickly ramps up to 0.01
kVol      portk   kVol, kPortTime; create a new version of kVol that has been filtered (smoothed) using portk
aVol      interp  kVol; create an a-rate version of kVol. Use intepolation to smooth this signal even further

imin      =       0; equilibrium position
imax      =       iBndRange * 1/12; max pitch displacement (in oct format)
kPchBnd	  pchbend imin, imax; pitch bend variable (in oct format)
kPchBnd   portk   kPchBnd, kPortTime; create a new version of kPchBnd that has been filtered (smoothed) using portk
aEnv      linsegr 0,0.005,1,0.1,0; amplitude envelope with release stage
kMul      aftouch 0.4,0.85; read in a value that will be used with gbuzz as a kind of tone control
kMul      portk   kMul,kPortTime; create a new version of kPchBnd that has been filtered (smoothed) using portk
